Most of the information about the decorators on the web is pretty confusing.  Here is my take on it.

Let us take a function

def add(a,b):
    return a+b

We call call this function using

add(4,5)

Which gives

9

No if we write a function which takes this function as input

def dec(our_func):
    def new_function(*args,**kwargs):
        Result = our_func(*args,**kwargs)
        print "The result is ",Result
    return new_function

We could now do this

ADD = dec(add)

ADD(4,5)

The result is  9

We can also overwrite the original function with the new function

add = dec(add)

now

add(4,5)

will give

The result is 9

We can also do this with the shortcut @ symbol in python

@dec
def add2(a,b):
    return a+b

add2(4,5)

The result is 9
