================


Python and Haskell and two languages that could be considered as opposite ends of a spectrum. While Python is about freedom, Haskell is about restrictions. Python was one of the best things to happen to me as a student. It made me execute ideas without thinking about the language. It helped me grow as a researcher. It was so much fun that on one of my projects I had coded in matlab to share with my colleagues while I had a python version written down for fun. Python is all about simple and readable code, So I never understood the need for list comprehensions (Most of my work requires numpy arrays) or functions like map or zip.

I discovered Haskell during a vacation. I was strangly attracted towards recursive functions. It brought back memories of “Gödel Escher Bach” by Douglas R. Hofstadter. Pure functions seemed beautiful and clean. I discovered a lot of concepts which really showed the difference between someone writing a pseudocode and clean, testable code. Needless to say I am loving the language. I am learning Monads now. Learning Haskell is indeed making me better at writing my python code. I hope I could soon translate some of the metaheuristics I wrote in python to haskell. All I need is the state monad.
