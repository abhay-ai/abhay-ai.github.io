Imagine a large pond with ducks or swans. When you drop some pieces of bread the birds closest to you immediatly react to it. When 2-4 birds are eating these crumbs birds further away start moving towards you. These birds are attracted towards this crowd mainly because there should be something unteresting here. (This is also the case with humans). This is observed also with fish. PSO makes use of this concept to search for better solutions to a problem.

There are two main steps involved in the movement of the particles,

+ Velocity Update

	The velocity is updated with the formula
	
		new particle velocity <- Inertia * old velocity
	                             + c1 * random(0,1) * (particle best - present location)
								 + c2 * random (0,1) * (global best - present location) (1)
		Where,
			Inertia is a value less than one, generally between 0.4 and 0.8
			c1 is the selfish/local influence factor which can be between 0 and 4, generally 1 or 2
			c2 is the global influence factor which can be between 0 and 4, generally 1 or 2

    In many implementations the Inertia value is gradually reduced over time. This helps in searching more locally. A higher *c1* will cause an exploitative search while a higher *c2* will cause an explorative search. The global best is the best solution available among all particles. Over time during the evolution of PSO a local best value is used instead of the global best. This local best depends on the n neighbours of the particles where n is less than the population. This helps the algorithm from going into a pre mature convergence. In this post I will focus on the simple PSO from the first paper in 1995.

+ Particle Update

	The particle is updated with the formula

		new particle location <- present location + velocity       (2)  


The algorithm for PSO is given below

    Generate Swarm of particles with n dimensions
    find fitness of the swarm and global best
    loop until target fitness or target steps reached
    	for each particle do 
            update particle velocity according to equation (1)
            update particle position according to equation (2)
            if fitness of new position is better than fitness of particle best
                then particle best <- new position
            endif	       
            if fitness of particle best is better than global_best
                then global_best <- particle_best
            endif
    endloop

I will discuss the implementation of the algorithm in my future posts.
