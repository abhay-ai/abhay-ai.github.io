Imagine a large pond with ducks or swans. When you drop some pieces of bread the birds closest to you immediatly react to it. When 2-4 birds are eating these crumbs birds further away start moving towards you. These birds are attracted towards this crowd mainly because there should be something unteresting here. (This is also the case with humans ;)). This is observed also with fish. PSO makes use of this concept to search for better solutions to a problem. 


    Generate Swarm of particles with n dimensions
    find fitness of the swarm and global best
    loop until target fitness or target steps reached
    	for each particle do 
            particle velocity <- Inertia * old_velocity + random(0,1) * (particle_best-present location) + random (0,1) * (global_best - present location)
            new_position <- present position+ particle _velocity
            if fitness of new position is better than fitness of particle best
                then particle best <- new position
            endif	       
            if fitness of particle best is better than global_best
                then global_best <- particle_best
            endif
    endloop
