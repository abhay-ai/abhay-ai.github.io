    Generate Swarm of particles with n dimensions
    find fitness of the swarm and global best
    loop until target fitness or target steps reached
    	for each particle do 
            particle velocity <- Inertia * old_velocity + random(0,1) * (particle_best-present location) + random (0,1) * (global_best - present location)
            new_position <- present position+ particle _velocity
            if fitness of new position is better than fitness of particle best
                then particle best <- new position
            endif	       
            if fitness of particle best is better than global_best
                then global_best <- particle_best
            endif
